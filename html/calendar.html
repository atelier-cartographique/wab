                <p>outdoor location (meeting point Rue des Tanneurs 170 Huidevetterstraat, 1000 Brussels)</p>
                <p>Exaggerated Footsteps is a sound walk performed at night. Participants are provided with a pair of metal plates to fix under their shoes. The plates are used during the walk as instruments that activate the acoustics of the encountered locations. After a first introduction to the project and the preparation of the shoes, the group will be led in a walk through the city. <br>
                Important: no fancy shoes, only robust shoes with eyelets.</p>

                <h2>Live performance Davide Tidoni</h2>
                <p>Davide will present a series of performances from his recent production. Through the staging of specific actions, Davide's performances function as metaphors that illustrate issues concerning physical presence, loss, distance, and the understanding of one's own limitations. Sound is used as an experiential/conceptual backdrop for exploring individual/collective agency and attentive listening.</p>

                    Outdoor location. <br>
                    Meeting point: 21:30, just outside Simonis metro station exit (if you face the Basililque, the exit is the one on the right side)<br>
                    Instructions: we will reach the location of the performance by bus; at the end of the performances there is the possibility to join for a walk with Clement Thiry.<br>
                    Those who are not staying for Clement's walk can return to Simonis before the last metro ride.

                <p>nadine/dinA - Nieuwbrug 3 Rue du Pont Neuf, 1000 Brussels</p>
                <p>This screening will feature Davide's most recent video works. The videos consist in a series of actions performed with a microphone. The actions are set up specifically for the camera and represent Davide's research on the microphone as performative instrument. The actions function as metaphors that illustrate issues concerning physical presence, loss, distance, and the understanding of one's own limitations. The microphone is treated as a human body exposed to unexpected situations.</p>
