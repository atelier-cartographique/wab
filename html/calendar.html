                <h2>Dark Corner walks</h2>
                <h2>Clément Thiry</h2>
                <p>place to be confirmed after reservation via loes@nadine.be (max 5 participants)</p>
                <p>Since two years Clément Thiry wanders in the city by night. He collects underlit spaces and places them on a map. They are forgotten spaces, small corners where rubbish gathers.</p>
                <p>This is where the urban entropy settles. This is where you go to get off the grid.</p>
                <p>The walks are invitations to contemplate and listen, following a meander on the map. These meditative promenades are punctuated by text readings and lullabies that are like hints to a fragmented fiction enhancing the hypnotic quality of the city at night.</p>

                <h2>WAB residency public presentation</h2>
                <h2>Clément Thiry &amp; Chloé Schuiten</h2>
                <p>Chloé and Clément experiment with new and alternative lifestyles, to extract themselves from the world and rethink it while sleeping on it. </p>
                <p>They met in February 2015 at an experimental carnival. Since then they have been meeting on a regular basis to fulfil their need for life experiences. They turn everything upside down in order to set themselves apart from everyday life and observe society from a distance. They tackle the three most fundamental aspects of everyday life : to eat, sleep and work. Their dynamic allows them to rapidly project themselves into delirious fictions and to fully realize them.</p>
                <p>“In September of 2017 we created a new outdoors experience. We needed to disappear for good from the human mess while still being at the centre of it. We wanted to vanish, do nothing, to be thoroughly passive. So we dug a hole on a roundabout and we went in hiding for a week without food, doing nothing except draw our dreams on empty water bottles.</p>
                <p>Then in March of 2018 we built a suspended nest made of old duvet sewn together and we settled in. We made it our offices for a week and covered the inside with erotic and wet paintings.</p>
                <p>In parallel to these experimentation capsules we have designed performative installations, lectures, shows and workshops to showcase our work. We had the opportunity to do so in various locations such as Le Point Ephemère, la librairie de Balzac à Rodin, le 100 in Paris as well as Saint-Luc and l'ERG in Brussels.”</p>

                <p>outdoor location (meeting point Rue des Tanneurs 170 Huidevetterstraat, 1000 Brussels)</p>
                <p>Exaggerated Footsteps is a sound walk performed at night. Participants are provided with a pair of metal plates to fix under their shoes. The plates are used during the walk as instruments that activate the acoustics of the encountered locations. After a first introduction to the project and the preparation of the shoes, the group will be led in a walk through the city. <br>
                Important: no fancy shoes, only robust shoes with eyelets.</p>

                <h2>Live performance Davide Tidoni</h2>
                <p>Davide will present a series of performances from his recent production. Through the staging of specific actions, Davide's performances function as metaphors that illustrate issues concerning physical presence, loss, distance, and the understanding of one's own limitations. Sound is used as an experiential/conceptual backdrop for exploring individual/collective agency and attentive listening.</p>

                    Outdoor location. <br>
                    Meeting point: 21:30, just outside Simonis metro station exit (if you face the Basililque, the exit is the one on the right side)<br>
                    Instructions: we will reach the location of the performance by bus; at the end of the performances there is the possibility to join for a walk with Clement Thiry.<br>
                    Those who are not staying for Clement's walk can return to Simonis before the last metro ride.

                <p>nadine/dinA - Nieuwbrug 3 Rue du Pont Neuf, 1000 Brussels</p>
                <p>This screening will feature Davide's most recent video works. The videos consist in a series of actions performed with a microphone. The actions are set up specifically for the camera and represent Davide's research on the microphone as performative instrument. The actions function as metaphors that illustrate issues concerning physical presence, loss, distance, and the understanding of one's own limitations. The microphone is treated as a human body exposed to unexpected situations.</p>
